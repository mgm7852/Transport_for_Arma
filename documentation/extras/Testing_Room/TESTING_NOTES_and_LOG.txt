//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I finally got my [url=http://epochmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34424-tutorial-quick-bulletpoint-style-notes-to-set-up-a-arma-3-epoch-dedicated-test-server/]Clean Test Environment[/url] ready and did some testing on this script as it stands
 
[b]CONCLUSIONS[/b]
As of script version 0.3.0 [u]all players[/u] can use [u]Fixed Destination Taxis[/u] Feature.
As of script version 0.3.0 [u]only Epoch AntiHack admins[/u] can use [u]clickNGo Taxis[/u] Feature. This is (I think) due to Epoch AH blocking KeyDown event therefore Transport for Arma script can not even receive a clickNGo-request from non-EpochAH-admin-players.
 
[b]TEST DETAILS[/b]
[spoiler]Date=20150413
Arma 3 version=1.42.130244
Epoch mod version=0.3.0.2_b3
Environment State=clean Arma3 dedicated server install + clean Epoch mod install + no other mods, no customizations, everything default.

test:
    antihack_Enabled = false;
    irrelevant:        antihack_cfgPatchesCheck = true;
    irrelevant:        admin state: I am NOT EpochAH admin
    irrelevant:        antihack_customVariablesCheck = false;
    all BE filters set to 3 (i.e.: log to both console & logfile)
    result: in central taxis, fixed destination taxi appeared as per normal. unable to take a ride and fully test as I have no money lol
    result: clickNGo button has no response at all. this script is currently not using EpochKEYDOWN apparently 'normal' keydown EH is not working
