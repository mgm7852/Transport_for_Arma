DevDiary? What what what?
Due to ever increasing word count in my posts I decided to divert my detailed updates and ramblings to a separate location, namely DevDiary under project's git repo.
Thus, all the four people who are interested in this stuff can access it and the rest can browse the forum to reach relevant information minus my booklets.
