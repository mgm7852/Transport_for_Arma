DevDiary 002 - GUI It Is
20150421

I am done with trying to find ways around Epoch AntiHack (and other AntiHacks) and its tendency to get in the way.
I will bite the bullet, learn "this gui stuff" which I have been avoiding like the plague and get a functional GUI, everything about Transport for Arma in one place.

At least the testing will be a BOOLEAN, it will either work or not, and if doesn't work we will know where to look.
PLUS IT SHOULD WORK! Even the basic GUI I've been testing (kindly provided by Mikie boy) is working just fine under any circumstance I could test so far.
