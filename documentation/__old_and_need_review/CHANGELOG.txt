0.0.14   New, cleaner init working fine
0.0.15   2-way comms working fine.

arghh!!	___Subbranch Version Jump from 0.1.x to 0.2.x due to spaghetti code symptom. Rewriting the whole script from scratch. New code will be based on limited scope precompiled functions and thus no more spaghetti, I hope.
0.2.0   The first error-less version under 0.2.0
0.2.1   Fixed Destination Taxis rewrite complete. Basic workflow It is fully functional now. NEXT: review & re-enable map tracking functionality. add clickNGo Service. addBus Service.

Added a new minor feature: if a player cannot complete an existing clickNGo workflow for any reason (due to getting killed, intentionally ejecting etc.) now he will not be unfairly banned from using the clickNGo service till next restart. A janitor service running every 5 mins, will allow him to regain access 15 minutes after his last successful clickNGo booking.

0.3.0b5   settings file line 459 global variable which is supposed to be "mgmTfA_configgv_createTaxiFixedDestination01Bool" was incorrectly named "mgmTfA_configgv_createTaxiFixedDestination01Bool", fixed now. Thanks for reporting DirtySanchez. Added to Taxi Drivers name database, there's 1 in 1200 chance he might get the next job and make a few bucks :-)
0.3.1		version number completely skipped due to accidentally enabling it while playing with Git/GitFlow and zero motivation to fix it with dirty command line commands :(

-----------------
20150420 - on the way to the next version:
		add: add dates to versions in CHANGELOG.
		security: improve security by replacing all call compiles with getVar
		bugfix: for seemingly never ending Call-a-Taxi-Paypoints #2 & #3 not properly added issue (issue #16 in tracker)
		add: Public Bus System concept design complete & drawBusRouteOnMap code working now. You will see some BUS settings in _settings.hpp file but BUSES ARE NOT WORKING YET (WIP).
		add: tests with a basic premade GUI, has two buttons so far: 'Call a Taxi' & 'Stop the bus!' << awaiting GUImaker's permission to include his work in the project
		change: code cleanup: misc. prep. work on the (long) way to opening code - function header standardization & documentation.
		change: code cleanup: remove some duplicate localvars that were left over during the mad dash to initial public alpha period.
-----------------
draft for post-2015-August version:
		change:	clickNGo has been renamed to TaxiAnywhere
		change:	GUI is properly implemented. e.g.: TaxiAnywhere has the following functions, each on a separate button:	"call taxi", "pay 1st mile fee", "change course", "exit vehicle".
		change:	greatly reduced systemChat clutter
		add:	New Service: Public Bus system
		add:	New Feature: StopVehicle function implemented (in the GUI, button is located at the bottom of each column)
		change:	behavior change - clicking on any GUI button now will also close the map (in addition to the GUI). in most cases map is open on screen just because GUI currently requires map open 3 times, hence convenient way of auto-closing it.
