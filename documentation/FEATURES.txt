//---------------------------------------
SERVICE OPERATION MODE #1	:		Fixed Destination Taxi Service
HOW THIS WORKS			:		In this mode, Players can book taxis from CATPs (Call-a-Taxi Point) which will then take them to Fixed Destination of their choice and will charge a predefined cost.
								Cost is defined in masterConfig file.
								List of CATPs defined in masterConfig file.

//---------------------------------------
SERVICE OPERATION MODE #2	:		clickNGo Taxi Service
HOW THIS WORKS			:		In this mode, Players from anywhere on the map can call a taxi to go to any other part of the map.
								Communication is done via radio thus, player must have a radio item.
								This service is not based on a fixed fee but taximeter based; as the Taxi keeps driving, driver keeps charging the player every n seconds x amounts of krypto.
								Cost is defined in masterConfig file.
								Radio requirement is defined in masterConfig file.
DEFAULT KEYS				:		Press INS key (default) (configurable in masterConfig) to call a clickNGo Taxi. << You will be asked to choose your destination. A clickNGo taxi will come to pick you up wherever you are and the drivel will take you to your requested destination.
											While inside a clickNGo Taxi, at any time, press NumPad* key to Set Course [i.e.: change the taxi's destination].
											ProTip:	do not open map then press * as this will lead to ZOOM IN function.
													instead, press the * key while map in closed state... 	(TfA will automatically open the map and will close it once you click & set the destination)

				SERVICE OPERATION MODE #3	:		Public Transport Units (a.k.a. Bus Service)
												In this mode, a player can hop on & hop off whenever he desires free of charge.
												Note that the vehicle type is not 'bus'.
												Taxi Corp (a for-profit organization) is in commercial contract with several boroughs providing public transport in their areas.
												Taxi Corp gets paid by the borough however general public (players) don't pay a dime for the bus ride [it's being covered with the taxes].
				DEFAULT KEYS				:		There are no special/custom keys for this. Players stand by the road and PTU will slow down and stop to let the player in. To get off, players use the actionMenu item (a.k.a.: MouseWheelOption) to request the PublicTransportUnit driver to stop.

							DISCLAIMER:	Taxi Corp strongly recommend seat belts to be fastened during the entirety of journey and customers not eject out of in-transit vehicles as there has been several cases of severe injury and death.
							In  the event of customer ejecting while in transit, driver will assume this is due to a mistake and will stop the vehicle and await for the customer to get back in.
							After a while, if the customer does not get back in, driver will be convinced that it was indeed an intentional eject-while-in-transit and he will carry on with his workflow [i.e.: as per customer's wishes, driver will leave the customer behind].
