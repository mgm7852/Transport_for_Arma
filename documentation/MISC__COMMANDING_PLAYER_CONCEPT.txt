A NOTE ON "COMMANDINGPLAYER" CONCEPT

In the current implementation (as of v.0.5.0) commandingPlayer is the original requestor of vehicle and it can never change.
In future releases, I am planning to make it an actionMenu option, thus using mousewheel the commandingPlayer (original taxiRequestor) can transfer control to another passenger.
