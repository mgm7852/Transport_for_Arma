KNOWN NO-ISSUES          last updated for: v.0.3.0
[misc] There is (1 in 1200) chance of driver name duplication; this chance is of a "dice-roll" nature on each new driver creation.	(won't fix now, might be fixed later. low possibility & low impact)
[misc] When player gets out of a taxi and not move an inch, in same cases driver might overrun him :(		for now, as soon as you get oun, just walk away		(won't fix now, might be fixed later).
[misc] BIS_fnc_*StackedEventHandler support (or lack there of):	I am aware of this project and I think it is a step towards the right direction; however its updates broke core functionality at least twice so far thus I consider it not mature enough. TfA will not support it at this time.	
[misc] PAYG charge does NOT happen exactly at the requested interval, for example, if in settings PAYG tick time is set to every 120 seconds, actual charge might occur at 121 or 123 seconds. This time drift is due to Arma 3 engine (being busy and not giving executing script at the exact scheduled time). While it can be finer tuned (with catch up topup payments for example), I find it unnecessary at this point to waste time on it.
