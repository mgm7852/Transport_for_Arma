TRANSPORT FOR ARMA - RELEASE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS

Q: How Can I Check The Integrity Of A Release?
A: An easy solution is provided: MD5 and SHA checksums provide a simple, means of verifying the integrity of a download.
   You can simply create a checksum (in the same way as the release manager) after download, and compare the result to the checksum downloaded from the main TfA Git repo.
   Obviously, this process does not provide for authentication and non-repudiation.

	Simply download 3 files listed below, place them in the same directory with .7z and double click on BAT script and observe the output. 
	You should either see integrity check:	"OK" or "FAILED".

	Files you will need:
	
		(1) GNPPG utility sha256sum.exe download it here:

		(2) Double Click to Verify Batch Script - download it here:
		https://gitlab.com/themgm/Transport_for_Arma/blob/master/release_engineering/verify_integrity_batch_script/_DOUBLE_CLICK_TO_VERIFY_INTEGRITY.BAT
		
		(3) Matching SHA256 signature for the archive you downloaded. 
		You can possibly find a link to this file in forum 1st post, in addition you find all builds and signatures here:
