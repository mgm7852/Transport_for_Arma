This project in its entirety is not a fork of any existing work in any way - it has been built from scratch.
Admittedly not time effective however I believe it is the best way of learning and I feel it was well worth the effort.

Having said that, I have happily utilized publicly available ideas and code pieces when license and practicalities permitted.

*Random position generator algorithm is based on several others work including Kronzky, JW Custom and several people on BI forums - too many to list each discussion contributor here.
*Map position updater code directly is taken from ShootingBlanks's proof-of-concept post in axeman's dayz-AI bus thread on opendayz forums.
*ActionMenu-on-object code is based on the code taken from computermancer's earplugs script

Many thanks to the authors of work listed above. Each bit helped me solve another piece of the big puzzle.

I also would like to thank the following people for their work an Arma. The list is in random order.

Bohemia Interactive
		Good game, excellent wiki.
		Thank you!

Andrew "AxeMan" Gregory
		I still remember the moment I opened "dayZ-AI-Bus-Route" armaholic page.
		The concept AI taking you from A to B in "DayZ world!" made me think of that old TV series twilight zone! :)
		Even though it appears very simple now (obviously!), att the time I felt it was advanced alien technology!
		Thanks for creating the AxeBus and sharing your work with the community.
		EDIT: axe also gave a hand with my wonderfully named 'variably named variables' thread - eternally grateful.
		EDIT: axe is now working 'playable hoverboards for Arma 3' - sainthood guaranteed!

Face
		Thank you very much Face, for showing me how to implement 'variably named variables' (arrays with incremented IDs as part of name).
		Without this technique I wouldn't be able to implement dynamic ACLs.
		You've been a great help really!!
		
vbawol
		creator of EpochMod - need I say more?
		Had Epoch not exist I probably wouldn't playing Arma - so thanks!
		vbawol also provided the improved, 2nd generation of payment processing functions.
		
Killzone_Kid
		I wanted to create this end-to-end taxi+bus script but didn't know where to start. I read a few tutorials but long story short, it didn't look good.
		Till I heard about Killzone_Kid's blog on a YouTube video - bookmarked instantly!
		Thanks for helping me and an ever growing army of scripters.

[FOCK] Mikie J
		Tutorial is good but the humour in it -which made me laugh more than any other technical reference!- makes it priceless entry point for new scripters.
		Thanks for sharing your experience!

ShootingBlanks
		As stated above, map position updater code is greatly appreciated - thanks!

computermancer
		Earplugs script is excellent and a MUST HAVE for any Arma player IMO. Thanks for releasing your work.
		In particular I have used (if I may say so optimized) actionMe bit.

Kronzky
		Urban Patrol Script is a classic taught across the globe in SQF scripting classes or it should be :)
		Still a tad complicated for my taste but I enjoy learning something new from it, every time I open it.
		Thanks!

JW Custom	
		Ultra Simple Patrol Script gave me some useful ideas, many thanks!
		
Vampire
		"Vampire's Epoch Mission Framework" is one of the detailed scripts I have studied to understand how this SQF-thingie work.
		I am also a long time fan of his work BTW. Thanks!

5nine
		5nine renewed my interest on the subject by posting that forum thread in EpochMod Forums about taxis.
		He then proceeded to releasing the first ever* taxi script for Arma. [* = As far as I know]
		Hats off!

second_coming
		second_coming has provided the required information to charge players using Epoch Crypto currency.
		Cheers SC!
		
nedfox	
		nedfox has provided the knowledge of packing an SQF script into a PBO file in his work: "Community (server side) MOD".
		Thanks a lot, this will save me at least 4-5 hours!

Gen0cide
		Gen0cide has provided version 0.1 of BattlEye filters.
		Also information on 3rd party AntiHack test results. Thanks Gen0cide!

DirtySanchez
		Thanks for being one of the first testers and bug reporters :)
Iceman77
		Thanks for the help on Arma 3 GUI with your work: 'Dialog Tutorial For Noobs [By A Noob]'
h8ermaker
		Thanks for the help on Arma 3 GUI with your work: Summary Video on 'Dialog Tutorial For Noobs [By A Noob]'
ebaydayz
		Thanks for the BattlEye filters guide!
