This project in its entirety is not a fork of any existing work; it's been built from scratch.
Admittedly not time effective however I believe it is the best way to learn and well worth  the effort.
Having said that, I have happily utilized publicly available ideas and code pieces where appropriate.

*Random position generator algorithm is based on several others work including Kronzky, JW Custom and several people on BI forums (too many to list here).
*Map position updater code directly is taken from ShootingBlanks's proof-of-concept post in axeman's dayz-AI bus thread on opendayz forums.
*ActionMenu-on-object code is based on the code taken from computermancer's earplugs script

Many thanks to the authors of work listed above. Each bit helped me solve another piece of the big puzzle.


I also would like to thank the following for their work. List is in random order. Apologies for those who haven't made it in yet.


Bohemia Interactive
		Good game, excellent wiki.
		Thank you!

Andrew "AxeMan" Gregory
		I still remember the moment I opened "dayZ-AI-Bus-Route" armaholic page.
		The concept AI taking you from A to B in "DayZ world!" made me think of that old TV series twilight zone! :)
		Thanks for creating the AxeBus and sharing your work with the community.
		EDIT: axe also gave a hand with my wonderfully named variable named variables thread - eternally grateful.

Face
		Thank you very much Face, for showing me how to implement variably named variables (arrays with incremented IDs as part of name).
		Without this technique I wouldn't be able to implement dynamic ACLs but now map-tracking is only available to authorized players 
		You've been a great help really!!
		
vbawol
		creator of EpochMod.
		If Epoch did not exist I probably won't be playing this game (Arma) by now so thanks! [more helis and bring back the old mozzie pls]
		
killzone_kid
		I wanted to create _this and possibly a few other scripts but I was  perplexed about where to start. I read a few tutorials but to a long story short it didn't look good.
		Till I heard about killzone_kid 's blog on a YouTube video. Immediately started reading it took a while to go through most articles and I still keep referring to often.
		Thanks for helping me and an ever growing army of JIP scripters.

[FOCK] Mikie J
		Tutorial is good but the humour in it -which made me laugh more than any other scripting reference!- makes it priceless entry point for new scripters.
		Thanks for sharing your experience!

ShootingBlanks
		Map position updater code is greatly appreciated - thanks!  ref: http://opendayz.net/threads/dayz-arma-ai-controlled-bus-route.10057/page-15#post-113820

computermancer
		That earplugs script is excellent and a MUST HAVE. Thanks for releasing your work.
		I have used (if I may say so optimized) actionMe

Kronzky
		Urban Patrol Script is a classic taught across the globe in SQF scripting classes or it should be :)
		Still a tad complicated my taste but I enjoy learning something new from this almost every time I open it.
		Thanks!

JW Custom	
		Ultra Simple Patrol Script gave me some useful ideas.
		
Vampire
		"Vampire's Epoch Mission Framework" is one of the detailed scripts I have studied to understand how this SQF-thingie work.
		(I am also a long time fan of his work BTW)
		Thanks!

5nine
		5nine renewed my interest on the subject by posting that forum thread in EpochMod Forums.
		He then proceeded to releasing the first* ever taxi script for Arma. [* = As far as I know]
		Hats off!

second_coming
		second_coming has provided the knowledge to accept payments [i.e.: take cash from an EpochMod player].
		Cheers SC!
		
nedfox	
		nedfox has provided the knowledge of packing an SQF script into a PBO file in his work: "Community (server side) MOD".
		Thanks a lot, this will save me at least 4-5 hours!

Gen0cide
		Gen0cide has provided version 0.1 of BattlEye filters.
		Also information on 3rd party AntiHack test results. Thanks Gen0cide!
