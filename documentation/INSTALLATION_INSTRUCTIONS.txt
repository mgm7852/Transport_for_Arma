TRANSPORT FOR ARMA - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for EPOCH MOD

1. Download latest release package. It should be in 7zip archive format with a file extension ".7z".
	NOTE: You can find the link in the forum 1st post.
	NOTE: You might want to verify the integrity of the archive package, should you wish so, read the document titled VERIFY_INTEGRITY.txt.

2. Extract the archive package with 7zip sofware.	NOTE: You can obtain the free 7zip software from: www.7-zip.org

3. Verify you have the correct files. When you extract the release package, contents should look like this:
INSTALL_ON_YOUR_SERVER__PBO_Files\0__Epoch_AutoStart_PBO____server-side\mgmTfA.pbo       	<-- server-side autostart addon for Epoch mod
INSTALL_ON_YOUR_SERVER__PBO_Files\1__Epoch_Altis_Mission_PBO_____client-side\epoch.Altis.pbo	<-- client-side multiplayer mission file
documentation\<many other files>
source_code\source_code.7z

4. Copy the "mgmTfA.pbo" file into your server's "<..>\arma3server\@Epochhive\" directory.

5. Copy the "epoch.Altis.pbo" file into your server's "arma3server\MPmissions\" directory.

6. Start your Arma 3 Epoch Multiplayer server and ensure you load the correct MPmission file (epoch.Altis.pbo).

7. When you join the game, to test Transport for Arma, quickly open and close your in-game map 3 times - you should see TfA GUI.

	simply download 3 files listed below, place them in the same directory with .7z and double click on BAT script.
	Files you will need:
	
		(1) GNPPG utility sha256sum.exe download it here:

		Also all 
		

Q: How Can I Check The Integrity Of A Release?
A: MD5 and SHA checksums provide a simple, means of verifying the integrity of a download. 
   You can simply create a checksum (in the same way as the release manager) after download, and compare the result to the checksum downloaded from the main Apache site. 
   Obviously, this process does not provide for authentication and non-repudiation as anybody can create the same checksum.
