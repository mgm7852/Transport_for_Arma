SECTION A - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS -- Adding TfA to an existing Epoch Mod installation
//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

STEP #1:     OBTAIN and EXTRACT
Download the latest release from project homepage at	https://gitlab.com/themgm/Transport_for_Arma
Extract it using 7zip archive manager. 
If necessary you can get 7zip here for free => http://www.7-zip.org/



STEP #2:     SERVER-SIDE PASTE FILE
Once you extract TfA release package, find the file 'mgmTfA.pbo', right-click COPY it.
Then PASTE the copied file into your Epoch mod (server-side) autostart addons directory:     <ARMA_3_SERVER_DIRECTORY>\@epochhive\addons\



STEP #3:     CLIENT-SIDE PASTE DIRECTORY
Extract the downloaded client-side file 'mgmTfA.Altis.pbo' using PBO Manager v.1.4 or a similar PBO unpacker software.
In the extracted content, right click on mgmTfA directory -- this is the one with 35+ files inside, click COPY.
Then PASTE the copied directory into appropriate location using ONE of the TWO OPTIONS below.

Step 3 - Option #1: If you are using a packed client-side Mission PBO:
1. Extract your PBO first so that you can modify it.
2. Paste the mgmTfA directory you copied above, into your freshly extracted client-side Mission directory:     <ARMA_3_SERVER_DIRECTORY>\MPmissions\<yourMission.yourWorld>\custom\mgmTfA
3. Do NOT repack your client-side Mission PBO yet, complete the two injectors below, only then repack it.

Step 3 - Option #2: If you are using a client-side Mission directory [without packing it into a PBO]:
1. Simply paste the mgmTfA directory you copied above, into your freshly extracted client-side Mission directory:     <ARMA_3_SERVER_DIRECTORY>\MPmissions\<yourMission.yourWorld>\custom\mgmTfA
2. Proceed with injectors below.



STEP #4:     ADD CLIENT-SIDE INJECTOR to init.sqf
Copy the 3 lines below and paste into the init.sqf file you have in your MPmissions directory:     <ARMA_3_SERVER_DIRECTORY>\MPmissions\<yourMission.yourWorld>\init.sqf
								//==================Transport for Arma client-side init==========================		// copy & paste these 3 lines into your existing file as shown on the right side. (if there is no such file, create a new blank text file first, and rename it to what you see on the right). ==>		ARMA_3_SERVER_DIRECTORY\<MPmissions>\<yourMapWorldname>\init.sqf
								if (!isServer) then {	[] call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "custom\mgmTfA\psczvuznuilitltt.sqf";	};
								//==================Transport for Arma client-side init==========================



STEP #5:     ADD CLIENT-SIDE INJECTOR to onPlayerRespawn.sqf
Copy the 3 lines below and paste into the onPlayerRespawn.sqf file you have in your MPmissions directory:     <ARMA_3_SERVER_DIRECTORY>\MPmissions\<yourMission.yourWorld>\onPlayerRespawn.sqf
								//==================Transport for Arma client-side onPlayerSpawn==================		// copy & paste these 3 lines into your existing file as shown on the right side. (if there is no such file, create a new blank text file first, and rename it to what you see on the right). ==>		ARMA_3_SERVER_DIRECTORY\<MPmissions>\<yourMapWorldname>\onPlayerRespawn.sqf
								waitUntil {vehicle player == player}; waituntil {!isnull (finddisplay 46)}; [] call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "custom\mgmTfA\xdrgjzogmpztzxnk.sqf";
								//==================Transport for Arma client-side onPlayerSpawn==================

ALL DONE!		That's it - just launch the game with the MPmission you've modified and your Transport for Arma should be at your service!

OPTIONAL TASK:     CONFIGURATION AND CUSTOMIZATION

Configuration Step #1: Extract the server-side autostart addon file 'mgmTfA.pbo'.

Configuration Step #2: Find the file _settings.hpp and take a backup of it before making changes -- not that you will make a mistake, in came computer  crashes :)

Configuration Step #3: Open the file with a text editor (Notepad++ or similar text editor recommended as they can help highlight syntax - to some extent).

Configuration Step #4: Modify the file as you wish. Its documentation is embedded to the file (as comments).


CONFIGURATION WARNING
Please be aware that there is no settings file syntax checking in the mod yet.
If a semicolon is omitted your TfA might not function properly. 
In same cases, due to bad syntax, Arma3server might not even start/allow players to connect so proceed with caution.
