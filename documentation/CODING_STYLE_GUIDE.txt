// Some of this is purely for taste but most of it is for functionality as build scripts expect things to be done in a certain way. Not following the below most likely WILL break automated build process.
+Comments go above code - not to its right.
+Tab space is 8.
+Single whitespace between double slash comment marker and the first word.
	ENCOURAGED:		// Enable or disable event logging 
	DISCOURAGED:	//Enable or disable event logging 
+Single whitespace between variable and operand and value
	ENCOURAGED:		allowFunctionsRecompile = 1;
	DISCOURAGED:	allowFunctionsRecompile=1;
	EXCEPTION: some operands such as for loops provide better readibility with zero whitespace, such as the below - these will be written without whitespace in  between () and variable name. Also between operand and variable.	for (i=0; i<10; ++i) {
+Variable words to be (1) CamelBack'd (3) capitalization exceptions will be accepted where applicable: Example: mgmTfA_CATP_blah Example2: Taxi_GUID
+Code is indented at each level with single tab (note that this has changed since first few alpha versions of this script).
	DISCOURAGED
	if(a>10) then {
			code here
	}
	ENCOURAGED
	if(a>10) then {
		code here
	}
+All comments to be commented out with // 		even several line long comments, and multi-line lists. This is due to potential future stripping of all comments by removing any line containing doubleslash
+diag_log labelling: Each entry should begin with [mgmTfA]. Next, single whitespace[full-filename.fileextension]. Next, single whitespace and [TVn] or [V] -- abbreviation of 'This Verbosity' or 'Verbosity' followed by verbosity level Number. Next add the (ThisIs %1) code bit. The rest of the line is free format"
	Example1: diag_log format ["[mgmTfA] [mgmTfA_scr_serverServeRequestor.sqf] [TV3] [PING from ASSETID: x] %1",time];
	Example2: diag_log format ["[mgmTfA] [mgmTfA_scr_serverServeRequestor.sqf] [V1] Goodbye, cruel world! I am self-terminating now!"
+Use the following local var to call functions with no return expectation
	_null = [] function
+On the server-side, pass all the data to functions as arguments - do not NEVER EVER assume global variable will hold the value we require.
+On the client-side, it is acceptable use to rely on global functions Example: requestedDestination
// EOF
